## Setup

- Create a discord account, log in, and navigate to the `application page`.
- Assign a name to the application and click on `Create`.

### Creating the .env file

- Copy the token given because it will be needed to log into the bot and use it in your server. Please make sure that no one else has access to this token because it gives the owner free access to the bot.

- Copy and paste the `.env.sample` to the new file `.env`
- Add the token to the `.env` file in the following manner:

```python
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```
<a name="bot-run"/>

### Running the bot

- After the above processes, open and run `launcher.py`

<a name="bot-invite"/>

## Inviting the bot to the server

- After adding the bot to the server, we need to create an `invite link` for the bot.
- Go to the `OAuth2` tab and select `scopes`.
- Choose `permissions` for the bot according to your requirements (for this bot, selecting `text permissions` is sufficient).
- Next, select the `copy` button above permissions and paste the `URL` in the browser.
- Choose a server for which you have `Manage Server Permissions` and click on `Authorize`.

The bot is thus added to the server successfully.
